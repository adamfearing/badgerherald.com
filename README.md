## Docs.

#### dom layout.

There's two main sections. There's the `pullout`, that sits on the left side of the screen, and there's the content `river` down the other side. The `river` is composed of 100% width elements named `blocks` that tile vertically down the screen. Everything that's in these blocks is then styled seperately (with a core set of normalized rules).
